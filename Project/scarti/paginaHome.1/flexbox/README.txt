 I've built several sites this year using Flexbox to design really nice card layouts, and this is an example on how to do it :)

Update 8/30 5:30pm : Squashed those pesky Safari Bugs. Need to QA in IE tomorrow when I'm at my desk and have a Windows machine available!

*To Do: work out card sizes better to be more flexible since some browser's weren't respecting percentages.*
